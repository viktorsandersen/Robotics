# Exercise 2

## Part 1 (ForWardKinematic)

- Create a Vector of Transforms Representing the UR-6-85-5-A Robot
- Create a function that does forward kinematics for the robot using a rw::math::Q to represent the joint angles.
- Compare your Result with the RobWork Build in methods

## Part 2 (InverseKinematics)

- Program a function to calculate the Jacobian
- The built-in type Jacobian can be used to represent the
Jacobian J(q)
- Give the function a vector of Transforms, solve for the A and
B part and merge it
